# immrax

`immrax` is a tool for interval analysis and mixed monotone reachability analysis in JAX.

Inclusion function transformations are composable with existing JAX transformations, allowing the use of Automatic Differentiation to learn relationships between inputs and outputs, as well as parallelization and GPU capabilities for quick, accurate reachable set estimation.

For more information, please see the full [documentation](https://immrax.readthedocs.io).

# Installation

## Setting up a `conda` environment

We recommend installing JAX and `immrax` into a `conda` environment ([miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/)).

```shell
conda create -n immrax python=3.11
conda activate immrax
```

## Installing immrax

A stable version of `immrax` is available on PyPi, and can be installed with `pip` as usual.

```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install immrax
```

If you have cuda-enabled hardware you wish to utilize, please install the `cuda` optional dependency group.

```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install immrax[cuda]
```

To test if the installation process worked, run the `compare.py` example.

```shell
cd examples
python compare.py
```

This should return the outputs of different inclusion functions as well as their runtimes.

## Installing `cyipopt` and `coinhsl` (optional)

If you would like to run the [pendulum optimal control example](examples/pendulum/pendulum.ipynb), you need to install IPOPT and the MA57 linear solver from HSL.

First, install `cyipopt` (more instructions [here](https://cyipopt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)).

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge cyipopt
```

This command can take a while to fully resolve.

To use the MA57 solver, you'll first need to acquire a package from [HSL](https://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/). While there are instructions [here](https://cyipopt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html#conda-forge-binaries-with-hsl), we highly recommend to instead use [ThirdParty-HSL](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-HSL) to install HSL globally.
Then, use a symbolic link to help the `conda` environment locate it.

```shell
ln -s /usr/local/lib/libcoinhsl.so $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libcoinhsl.so
```
